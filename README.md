# Simple RAG App with LangChain Ecosystem

## Project Overview
Build a document Q&A system that demonstrates RAG, LangGraph, LangChain, and LangSmith integration.

## Features
- Upload and process PDF/text documents
- Vector-based document retrieval
This project gives you a complete RAG application that demonstrates all the key components:
RAG Concepts: Document chunking, vector embeddings, similarity search, and context-aware generation
LangGraph: Orchestrates the workflow with clear states (retrieve → generate) and shows how to build complex AI workflows
LangChain: Handles all the heavy lifting - document loading, text splitting, embeddings, vector stores, and LLM interactions
LangSmith: Automatically traces every step, giving you insights into performance, costs, and errors
The project is simple enough to understand quickly but comprehensive enough to showcase real RAG capabilities. You can start with basic text files and gradually add more complex documents to see how the system performs.
